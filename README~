SearchGlass:
------------

SearchGlass is basically a rudimentary search engine that searches for a query starting from a given page and pages linked from it, and returns the list of all pages that match the keyword, sorted. The algorithm used for sorting is similar to Google's PageRank. 

Please note that this search engine is highly limited and cannot actually be used to search queries on the web. It is in no way a competition to Google, so Google needn't worry :-)

The reason for this is that the indexer and the crawler work only on certain pages with relatively little HTML and follow a specific format for links to other web pages. But I do hope to rectify this shortcoming and make my search engine more powerful once I've completed Udacity's course on Web Development.

To run the script:
------------------

Simply run the script named 'CrawlerScript.py'. A default start page and a keyword has been provided.
